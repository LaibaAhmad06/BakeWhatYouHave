## 🧠 How the Matching Works

1. You select ingredients from the left panel
2. Each recipe is scored: `matched ingredients ÷ total ingredients × 100`
3. Recipes with at least 1 match are shown, sorted by score (highest first)
4. Recipes with 0 matching ingredients are hidden
5. Ingredient names are normalized before comparison (e.g. `"Butter (softened) - ½ cup"` → `"butter"`) so matching is always accurate
